# playlist-graphql
trying out graphql

Simple application to show playlists of a user.
The Grand idea was to make sharable playlists. Need to start working on it again. 

And, also to try out `graphql` when it first came out and I discovered it. It was such a pain. But it was so worth it.

### Requirements
- nodejs
- database: in memory :D

`npm install && nodemon index.js`

### Libraries
- koa
- graphql
